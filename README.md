## About

Welcome to CarbonIQ!

CarbonIQ is an open-source library for automating the decarbonization and carbon tax calculation process for protocols. It simplifies the integration of carbon offsetting and taxation, allowing developers to focus on building their applications. Our library provides a user-friendly API that can be integrated into any protocol, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.

CarbonIQ allows for easy carbon emissions calculation and offsetting, as well as carbon tax implementation. CarbonIQ is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to use. It is built on top of the Carbonable API and uses advanced algorithms to calculate carbon emissions and taxes.

Our team is committed to promoting sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of the blockchain industry. By using CarbonIQ, developers can easily integrate carbon offsetting and taxation into their protocols, helping to create a more sustainable future.

You can find the code on our Github repository and we welcome contributions and feedback from the community.

Thank you for considering CarbonIQ, and we look forward to building a more sustainable future together.
